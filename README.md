# Entertainment in a Click
This project is part of the Software Requirements Engineering course under my bachelor's degree in software engineering

## Introduction
The entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia has witnessed a significant growth in recent years. To support the country's Vision 2030, the government established the General Entertainment Authority (GEA) to organize and lead the entertainment sector. However, with the rapid growth, the management and organization of entertainment activities have become more challenging, involving various stakeholders such as customers, service providers, and GEA staff.

## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a single interactive iOS application called "Entertainment in a Click" to address the challenges faced in the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia. The application will provide a centralized platform for managing and organizing entertainment activities. This project focuses on specifying the requirements and UML models for the SBMS system. and providing a screen mockups for the system.


here are the mockups screens for the system:
